Creating a completely responsive personal portfolio website with dark/light mode involves combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure the content, style the layout, and implement the interactive features.  
  



### Home Page Explanation  
The design is modern and vibrant, featuring a green and black colour scheme. The left-side navigation menu offers links such as "Home," "About," "Services," "Portfolio," and "Contact," with a settings icon at the top right. The main content introduces "html | devlyss," a dedicated front-end developer skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Icons for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn provide social media connections, and a "Download CV" button invites visitors to access the developer's resume. On the right, a 3D-rendered character labelled "Web Developer" adds a visually striking element, creating a strong first impression of the developer's skills and personality.
